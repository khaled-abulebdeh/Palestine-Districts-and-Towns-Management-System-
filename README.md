# Palestine Districts and Towns Management System 

## Overview

This project implements a data management system for Palestinian districts and their towns.  
It uses **Doubly Linked Lists** to store data and applies **Radix Sort** to alphabetically sort districts,  
and sorts towns based on their population in ascending order.

Developed in **C Language**, the system provides a full menu-driven interface allowing loading, sorting, updating, and saving district and town information.
